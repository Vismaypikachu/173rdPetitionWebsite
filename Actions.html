<p>An option available to address your speeding concerns is for you and your neighbors to borrow a radar dolly.  This unit gives motorists feedback on the speed at which they are driving on a digital reader board, encouraging them to obey the speed limit.  Should you and your neighbors like to borrow a radar dolly, please sign up on https://bellevuewa.gov/city-government/departments/transportation/safety-and-maintenance/traffic-safety/traffic-safety-request-forms/radar-dolly-request-form  </p>
<p>
    We also have Traffic Safety Yard Signs, an education program that involves lending communities portable signs that encourage motorists to respect the neighborhood and drive responsibly.  These signs are available with four different messages:  Drive Like You Live Here, Eyes On the Road, Slow Down/Kids Live Here, and Slow Down/Set the Pace.  If you would like City staff to deliver and install these signs at your home, please fill out and submit the form http://bellevuewa.gov/yardsigns indicating which signs you would like to request.  Please feel free to share this link with your neighbors as well should they wish to request traffic safety yard signs.
